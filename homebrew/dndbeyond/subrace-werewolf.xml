            <p>Werewolves are humans that have been transformed by a curse to become powerful beasts that stalk the night.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Constitution score increases by 1.<br/>
                <span class="feature">Heightened Senses.</span>You begin to adopt to the improved abilities or a natural predator. You gain advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Lycan Regeneration.</span>At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Cursed Weakness.</span>You have vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Bloodlust.</span>At the start of your turn, if you’ve taken any damage that drops you below 1/2 hitpoints since the beginning of your last turn, you must make a Wisdom saving throw to maintain control. The DC equals 6, or half of the total damage you’ve taken from attacks since your last turn, whichever number is higher. On a failed save, you are forced to transform into Hybrid form (does not use Hybrid Transformation power). If already in Hybrid form, you must move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against the creature. If there is more than one possible target, the DM chooses the target. You then regain control for the remainder of your turn.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Cursed Weakness.</span>You have vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Moon Madness.</span>The sight of the Moon drives the beast mad. Make a DC 15 Wisdom Save for every 10 minutes in moonlight.  If you fail, you transform into Hybrid form.  Every turn you are in Hybrid form while in Full Moon Light you trigger bloodlust.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Hybrid Transformation</span>You learn to control the lycanthropic curse that lives in your blood. As an action, you can transform into your Hybrid form. This form lasts for 30 minutes. You drop all equipment and can no longer speak common. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using an action on your turn. You automatically revert to your normal form in you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.<br/>
